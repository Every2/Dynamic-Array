### Why named vector instead Dynamic Array?

People isn't acquainted to data structure original name, normally we know dynamic array as list, arraylist, vector and etc... I opted Vector because i use C++ and vector is a dynamic array.

### This is not the most performatic implementation?

Yeah, I know, but I'm trainning my C knowledge. In future more optimized and safe operations should come.

### Why in C, not in C++ or Python?

Just wanted remember the C bases.

### Why the print macro was removed?

Portability. Now you can run the code in every C version.

### To print the elements inside dynamic array, I need use a loop?

Yeah, this's an array in the end.

### Why enums instead void pointers?

Portability and safety, void pointers can be really unsafe and problematic in some archictures so I removed and switch to enums with union.
