Why named vector instead Dynamic Array?
People isn't acquainted to data structure original name, normally we know dynamic array as list, arraylist, vector and etc... I opted Vector because i use C++ and vector is a dynamic array.

This is not the most performatic implementation?
Yeah, I know, but I'm trainning my C knowledge.

Why in C, not in C++ or Python?
Just wanted remember the C bases.

I need use the main.c file?
Not really, main.c is more like a test file. If you wanna use this you can just use vector.h

Why the print macro just support 3 types?
I wanted create a generic print, but I opted just to add these 3, in future I update (maybe not).

To print the elements inside dynamic array, I need use a loop?
Yeah, this's an array in the end.

I tried run this project, but I have problems with _Generic, What I do?
Search how use your compiler in c11 standard or above.
